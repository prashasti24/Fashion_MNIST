# Fashion_MNIST

The Fashion MNIST dataset was created by e-commerce company, Zalando.It is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

## Problems with the Standard MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset:
1. It’s far too easy for standard machine learning algorithms to obtain 97%+ accuracy.
2. It’s even easier for deep learning models to achieve 99%+ accuracy.
3. The dataset is overused.
4. MNIST cannot represent modern computer vision tasks.

*Zalando, therefore, created the Fashion MNIST dataset as a drop-in replacement for MNIST. The Fashion MNIST dataset is identical to the MNIST dataset in terms of training set size, testing set size, number of class labels, and image dimensions.*

## Why we made Fashion MNIST

The original MNIST dataset contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. "If it doesn't work on MNIST, it won't work at all", they said. "Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."

Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset, helping people to benchmark and understand machine learning algorithms. It encourages researchers to design unequivocal experiments to understand algorithms better.
